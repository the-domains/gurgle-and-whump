# The Blowholes are Gurgle & Whump!

Vacation houses on Eleuthera are sometimes named for what you see.  **Gurgle & Whump **is named for what you hear--there are two blowholes near the water's edge.  Sometimes they gurgle, sometimes they whump! 

Other nearby sounds include the roll of the surf, the rattle of palms and the wind in the pines.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0e89c75b-4538-4dad-adab-9403e5d847f6.png)
